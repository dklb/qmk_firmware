tapping term to 150
remove reset key
bug: double tapping any top row key in the Raise layer (Symbols) opens iterm. (Only happens when hotkey is set to doubletap space, not when it's ctrl)
make sure that KC_LSFT & CTRL is mapped on WASD layer. & change TAB to OPT
Add Tap-Dance KC_LSFT -> KC_CAPS
fix up LED lighting settings
